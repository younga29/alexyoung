                <p>So, you decided to come and read all about my hobbies and interests? Lucky for you, I have very interesting hobbies and interests.</p></br>
            <h2>Cars</h2>
                <p> First off I want to mention that I am a car enthusiast and love classic cars. This all started when I was in 6th grade, I was with my dad and he was weatching a movie called 2 Fast 2 Furious. This may seem like I am just yur everyday person who says they are a car enthusiast but only likes one kind of car. After watching that movie, I wanted to know everything about cars and how they work. I started off by looking into my favorite type of car, American Muscle. I have always been drawn towards older cars since they represent a time when everything was simpler and nobody worried about gas prices, or how much greenhouse gas their car made. The reason I am so drawn to that is because that is how I feel now. I try not to worry about how much it costs to fill up my tank or how much pollution I am causing. Right now I am trying to live my life without worry. </p>
                <p>This may seem like I am just a person that likes to look at cars and not put in any work to get them. For me the most impressove thing about an older car is the work that has been done to keep it nice. Whether it is from resoration, or just treating it nicely, I think that is super impressive. When it comes to me I am a car enthusiast with a love of clasic cars but I honestly can say that I really don't mind all of the other cars. Everybody always thinks that a car enthusiast means that they have to focus on one type of car. In my book, being a car enthusiast means that yu actually have the ability to appreciate all cars no matter the make, model, or year. To me a car enthusiast can still have a sweet sport for a specific type of car, but they don't have ti make that one car their lifestyle.</p></br>
            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <h4>When it comes to hobbies, I am not really sure that I have one specific thing I do. When it comes to hobbies I have several that I would consider a hobby. This includes playning video games, driving around, swimmming, or listening or playing music.</h4>
            <h3>Video Games</h3>
                <p>When it comes to video games I have been playing for as long as i can remember.To me video games are stress relief and they are enjoyable. I have played video games on so many different consoles such as: Playstation 2, Playstation 3, Playstation 4, Nintendo Wii, Nintendo Switch, Xbox 360 and so many more.</p></br>
            <h3>Just Driving Around</h3>
            <h3>Swimming</h3>
                <p>This has always been something that is important to me. Everybody has those memories from their early childhood that they weirdly remember and mine is swimming. Ever since I can remember I have always loved to swim. Accoding to my parents I was a very fast learner with swimming. All throughout my life I have always loved swimming, but everything changed one summer. One of my parents friends and fellow swim club member was coach of the swim team for that swim club and he asked if I wanted to join and try it out. That was the day I took my perspective of swimming to a whole new level. I joined the swim team and did very well although i struggled at first. After a couple years of swimming on a team in the summer I was doing better than I had ever done before. That was the year that I graduated middle school and moved on to high school. When signing up for the high school swim team I noticed that the coach's name looked familiar, it was no other than my swim coach from the swim club. Up until my senior year I was consistently on the swim team and getting better as the days went on. MNy senior year I signed up for the swim team and then went home in a good mood. When i told my parents they told me to quit the team immediately and email my coach to tell him I needed to focus on my grades. My heart was broken and I felt like i lost a big part of me that day.</p></br>
            <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>Whether it is listening to music or playing it, music has aklways been a huge part of my life. When I was in 6th grade I decided to pick up the guitar because I thought it would be cool. After a couple months of playing i decided that it was not right for me and I gave it up. When my 8th grade year hit i decided to join Elder High School's grade school band and i picked up the drum. Since then I have gotten better at it and have never stopped loving it. I was in the marching band from my sophomore year all the way to my senior year. It was the best experience of my life and i met so many friends from band, it was an experience that changed my life and I am thankful that I was able to do it. Besides playing music i have always loved to listen to it. I enjoy all types of music but i love heavy metal and rock. I get a lot of hate when I say I listen to heavy metal but honestly I don't care about what others have to say, I like it and I am going to stick with it. </p></center>
