        <span style="font-family:Courier"><p>Oh! You're still here? I guess you would like to know what I plan on doing with myself after I graduate. I'll tell you.</p>
        <p>Whenever somebody brings up the future I always want to tell them what i have planned.The first thought that enters my mind when I think of the future is my girlfriend, Katrina. I have always felt that family is important and to keep your loved ones close and with her it is the same thing. When I graduate I know that i am going to stay at home for a couple years so that I can pay off my college debts, or at least get a start. After that I plan on moving somewhere secluded. I grew up in a suburban neighborhood so I am used to loud noises and construction, but also birds chirping and sometimes if I'm lucky,peace and quiet.</p>
        <p>I have always wanted to live out in the countryside, away from loud noises and all of the things that stress me out on a daily basis. I honestly don't think i could see myself anywhere else in the future. I have so many hobbies that would be perfect if I had a house that has land and space to run and play.</p>
        <p>Enough about things that can be bought with money. In the future I would love to have a family. Growing up I learned thast one of the most important values to have in your life is family. I have learned that keeping family close is very very important. I hope to have at least 2-3 kids of my own. Something else that I possiblly plan on doing in the future is adoption. Most people would ask why would you adoopt when you can have kids of your own. I have the perfect answer for that. When it comes to adoption I think of it as an oppotrunity to give a child a better life and help them out. It is something that i am considering doing in the future but it is going to take somer thinking time. </p></br>
