            <h3>My Life Up To This Point</h3>
            <span style="font-family:Courier"><p>If you are reading this then you probab ly decided to learn more about me. I guess I will start by saying that my name is Alexander Michael Young. I am currently living in Cincinnati where I was born and raised.</p>
            <p>I was Born on July 29, 2001. I was born almost a month too early and had to stay in the NICU for almost a month. I'm sure you can understand how scared my parents were. Okay, I think you are done hearing me ramble on about me as a baby and you want to hear more about how i got here.</p>
            <p>I was raised as a Christian and I am very religious. I went to a private elementary and middle school known as St. Dominic. After i graduated from there I decided i wanted to continue on with my religion and decided to go to Elder High School.</p>
            <p>When i was in high school one of my biggest fears was not being able to figure out what i wanted to do after high school. In my sophomore year i was considering continuing mny religious path and becoming a priest. After considferation i decided that i wanted to have a family so i decided i wanted to go to college.</p>
            <p>I had a lot of trouble deciding what i wanted to do in college. Originally I wanted to be a physical therapist and I app[lied to a coupke colleges with that major in mind. That still didnt feel quite right though. I wanted to get a job that would be very important in the future. After even more consideration i decided I would pursue Cybersecurity.</p>
            <p>Currently I am enrolled at Northern Kentucky University and I study Cybersecurity with a minor in Computer Forensics. People always tell me that I am going to be making so much money when I get out of college. To me it is not all about the money, if it was i would work to become a doctor. Now if im recalling correctly i didnt say that I am studying to be a doctor, I am studying Cybersecurity. I am studying what i thought i would enjoy and a topic that would challenge me. Thats exactly how it is anbd I couldn't be happier.</p></br>
            <h3>My Family</h3>
            <p>I currently live with my family in Cincinnati Ohio and love every minute of it. I am lucky enough to have both of my parents in my life and involved and interested in what I do. I can't say that i know many parents who actually enjoy to what their kids do in college, most of the time i see them just nod and act like they care. Maybe they do care, Who knows? With my parents I am able to talk to them about my school and they will give me their honest opinion. They always support mew in whatever decision I make no matter how stupid it is. They might tell me its a stupid idea but they will always support me and thats what I love. They are the hardest workers I have ever met and they always want to help no martter how tought the problem is.</p>
            <p> Next up we have my partner in crime, my brother. I only have one sibling but I think I can speak for both of us and say that one sibling is enough for us. When it comes to my brother we are close but somewhat distant. My brother and I are polar opposites, he is athletic and I am not, he loves rap music and I love heavy metal, he hates fruit and I love it, he loves eggs and I hate them. You see the pattern here? When it comes to my brother we have a lot of disagreements but we always have each other's backs, through thick and thin. </p>
            <p>Lastly, I would like to mention my two puppies, Ryder and Kobe. Ryder and Kobe are black Labrador Retrievers who seem big and scary but are just big. When it comes to these two, you can have them being super protective when they don't know you, but theyt are super sweet and loving when they know and trust you. My dogs are my reasonn for not giving up and I love that they are always with yhou if you are feeling upset.</p></span>
